What's that? First of all, I have smoke. Greasy smoke, not very strong, but noticeable. In addition, heavy sherry with its dark fruits. Plums wrapped in bacon. Grilled bananas with cinnamon. Forest soil with porcini mushrooms. Traditional balsamic vinegar, old and viscous. Some pot roast, served in a dusty library. Porrödes leather. It is fascinating that with the old, set and heavy impression, even a blood orange finds its way into the nose. Occasionally she comes through, but quickly loses behind leather, plum and bacon again.  Time weakens the smoke a bit. To the plums come over-ripe dates and figs. Some sweetness prevails. Chocolate, about 70% cocoa content. Gradually the wood gets stronger too. The oak is seasoned with nutmeg and pepper. Cherry is now added.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Plum juice, warm and full. Sweet cherry, chocolate, this time rather milk chocolate. Thick and heavy, the whisky is in the mouth. The smoke is hard to hold. Leather, again I imagine a library. But cherry juice is there too. And of course, the oak is not to be misjudged. Spicy prickles the mouth and leathery, musty tobacco forms and can be swallowed after swallowing. Through the throat to the nose comes again smoke, musty and slightly greasy. Dark chocolate.\\n\\n피니쉬(Finish): Medium to long. Modrig, leathery. Rather dry.

A freshly baked plum and cinnamon pastry is lying around somewhere, it's still quite warm. Someone poured a lot of sweet syrup over it. Or was it the maggi bottle? Probably both! Once the palate is involved, the chocolate becomes more intense and rosemary is added very slightly.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Full and sparkling. Quite sweet with cherries and plums. The oak is immediately everywhere and captivates the mouth with a tingling sensation. She lets some tobacco through.

Mineral notes of wet stones and chalk. Barley sugar as well. After a while the classic Ardbeg citrussy notes of lemon and lime intermingled with soft smoke come through Complex but very fragile at the same time.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Now more on the peaty side of the spectrum. So plenty of phenols, kippery notes of dried shellfish and smoked mussels. Anchovies and salmon on a barbecue. Brimstone. Later on oaky notes of sandalwood. Sultanas and toasted almonds as well. It's all quite 'naked' and clean.\\n\\n피니쉬(Finish): Medium long and drying. Iodine and kelp. A little Ginger. Roasted coffee. Vicks and old leather at the end.\"),\n",

Lemon juice, lime zest, fresh squeezed cinchonas. It's a wonderful combination of burning, meaty, greasy peat with sharp and fresh citrus sensations\\n\\n맛(Taste): Strong notes of raw malted barley! Cereal sugars, citrus laced honeys, strong dusty and musty notes, along with potently bitter and ultra-oily peat. A massively strong arrival, this one needs a couple drops of water. That citrus notes and barley sugars meld together into a single malty citrus flavour while the other peat sensations are toned down\\n\\n피니쉬(Finish): Extremely oily and clinging with a very long finish. All kinds of herbal oils, aromatic oak oils and spices, some farmyard funk, and something that makes me think of limestone\"),\n",
