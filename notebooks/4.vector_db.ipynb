What's that? First of all, I have smoke. Greasy smoke, not very strong, but noticeable. In addition, heavy sherry with its dark fruits. Plums wrapped in bacon. Grilled bananas with cinnamon. Forest soil with porcini mushrooms. Traditional balsamic vinegar, old and viscous. Some pot roast, served in a dusty library. Porrödes leather. It is fascinating that with the old, set and heavy impression, even a blood orange finds its way into the nose. Occasionally she comes through, but quickly loses behind leather, plum and bacon again.  Time weakens the smoke a bit. To the plums come over-ripe dates and figs. Some sweetness prevails. Chocolate, about 70% cocoa content. Gradually the wood gets stronger too. The oak is seasoned with nutmeg and pepper. Cherry is now added.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Plum juice, warm and full. Sweet cherry, chocolate, this time rather milk chocolate. Thick and heavy, the whisky is in the mouth. The smoke is hard to hold. Leather, again I imagine a library. But cherry juice is there too. And of course, the oak is not to be misjudged. Spicy prickles the mouth and leathery, musty tobacco forms and can be swallowed after swallowing. Through the throat to the nose comes again smoke, musty and slightly greasy. Dark chocolate.\\n\\n피니쉬(Finish): Medium to long. Modrig, leathery. Rather dry.

A freshly baked plum and cinnamon pastry is lying around somewhere, it's still quite warm. Someone poured a lot of sweet syrup over it. Or was it the maggi bottle? Probably both! Once the palate is involved, the chocolate becomes more intense and rosemary is added very slightly.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Full and sparkling. Quite sweet with cherries and plums. The oak is immediately everywhere and captivates the mouth with a tingling sensation. She lets some tobacco through.

What's that? First of all, I have smoke. Greasy smoke, not very strong, but noticeable. In addition, heavy sherry with its dark fruits. Plums wrapped in bacon. Grilled bananas with cinnamon. Forest soil with porcini mushrooms. Traditional balsamic vinegar, old and viscous. Some pot roast, served in a dusty library. Porrödes leather. It is fascinating that with the old, set and heavy impression, even a blood orange finds its way into the nose. Occasionally she comes through, but quickly loses behind leather, plum and bacon again.  Time weakens the smoke a bit. To the plums come over-ripe dates and figs. Some sweetness prevails. Chocolate, about 70% cocoa content. Gradually the wood gets stronger too. The oak is seasoned with nutmeg and pepper. Cherry is now added.\\n\\n맛(Taste): Plum juice, warm and full. Sweet cherry, chocolate, this time rather milk chocolate. Thick and heavy, the whisky is in the mouth. The smoke is hard to hold. Leather, again I imagine a library. But cherry juice is there too. And of course, the oak is not to be misjudged. Spicy prickles the mouth and leathery, musty tobacco forms and can be swallowed after swallowing. Through the throat to the nose comes again smoke, musty and slightly greasy. Dark chocolate.\\n\\n피니쉬(Finish): Medium to long. Modrig, leathery. Rather dry.
