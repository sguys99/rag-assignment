I expected more blend, especially with the reduction and the now 22 years in the bottle.\nLet's not exaggerate either, the wood is very nice, noble, with a mix of graphite, pencil, firecracker powder, and a very light burnt wood. Lightly roasted almonds and hazelnuts.\nOn the fruit side, we are a little on the plum skin, the orange zest. Slightly astringent.\nAeration is really essential here to balance things out. Half an hour later, everything has changed.\nWe then have a little more plum juice, with a light mango and milk chocolate. The wood is more lively and waxed.

맛(Taste) [점수: 91.0]: On the palate, the wood is forward again, with a frank bitterness. Pepper, rancio, bitter dark chocolate, kirsch.\nTobacco, cigar, very light undergrowth, liquorice, molasses.\nLight gingerbread.\nThe fruit is more discreet and cooked, with blackberry, plum, and always a little hot mango.\nIt's less fresh than the nose, deeper, heavy and powerful.

피니쉬(Finish) [점수: 92.0]: Very long finish on pineapple peel, cooked mango, plum, and always a big dose of wood. Pepper, liquorice, blackberry leaf."

The malt swirls syrupy in the glass gently in my hand. Hot plum cake, always juicier, wildflower honey, as I like to buy it in the Turkish village, runs slowly over huge dried dates. A handful of dried figs are somewhere in between. Among all this heavy sweet oak with a large piece of Sacher cake. I do not want this dram to end, so I could breathe forever.

맛(Taste): Sweet and fruity, he glides in the mouth and back, while he puts everything dry, what he encounters. Strong barrel wort comes from the malt. It tingles at the tip of the tongue, while the oak tastes old, woody, almost dusty. Tobacco as sweet as I have not experienced mingles with the wood tones. Grapfruits lightly dusted with sugar join. A strong piece of chocolate with 85% cocoa content.

피니쉬(Finish): Tannins and the dark chocolate are literally in the mouth. The grapefruits and strong espresso peel on the tobacco. Slowly the malt releases some leather. The oak gives way to dry and after a long while, it gives back the sweet aromas of sherry."
